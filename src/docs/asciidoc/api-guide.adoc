=== Error Handling

==== Successful Requests

Successful requests return a response with HTTP status 200 (OK) or 201 (CREATED) or 204 (NO CONTENT). 
The response body contains a JSON structure, except for 204 status responses.

==== Validation Errors

POST requests against the Book API expect a JSON structure in the request body. 
PUT requests also expect a JSON structure, except for linking requests. 
GET, PUT, and DELETE requests expect to have a valid path variable. 
If the JSON structure contains invalid values, the API returns a response 
with HTTP status 422 (UNPROCESSABLE ENTITY) that includes an error 
JSON structure object with a message field and a possible array of errors.

==== General Errors

If an unexpected error occurs during the processing of a request, 
the Book API returns a response with HTTP status 500 (INTERNAL SERVER ERROR).
